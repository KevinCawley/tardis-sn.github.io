TARDIS is developed by a multidisciplinary team. 

The development of TARDIS and associated software tools are made 
possible through several coordination roles fulfilled by community 
members. This encompasses a broad scope of responsibilities ranging 
from direct package development to communication, distribution, and 
managerial activities. To know about our other members, visit the 
<a href="../collaboration/">Collaboration</a> page.

## Core Team

TARDIS Core Team is responsible for:
 - Overseeing the activities and sets the goals for the TARDIS Collaboration
 - Identifying science opportunities that match TARDIS capabilities or coordinates the addition of capabilities
 - Identifying education opportunities such as workshops, lecture development, and outreach opportunities

### Members & Roles
Current TARDIS core team members are as follows (you can click on the role to know what it means):
